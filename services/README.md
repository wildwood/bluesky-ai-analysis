# 📂 Services Setup

This folder contains **sample `systemd` unit files** for running the Bluesky ingestion and embedding pipeline on a Linux server (VPS).

---

## ✅ How to use

1️⃣ **Copy the service file to your system**

```bash
sudo cp bluesky-ingest.service /etc/systemd/system/

2️⃣ Edit the file

Open it with sudo nano or your editor of choice.

Update:

WorkingDirectory → your actual project folder path.

ExecStart → correct .venv path and script name.

--db-path if your database lives on a mounted volume.

User= → your real Linux user name (e.g. ubuntu or davidbrandt).

3️⃣ Reload systemd

Anytime you change a .service file:

sudo systemctl daemon-reload

4️⃣ Start the service

sudo systemctl start bluesky-ingest

Check status:
sudo systemctl status bluesky-ingest

Follow logs live:
sudo journalctl -u bluesky-ingest -f

5️⃣ Enable auto-start on boot

sudo systemctl enable bluesky-ingest
